# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Hand-Written-English-Digit-Recognition-Using-MNIST-Dataset
The given code with the comments are the recognition of handwritten digits using MNIST dataset by deep neural network

A huge shoutout to the #sentendex for his playlist and website from where I learned the implementation of this project using
Keras API on top of Tensorflow

The code is written with comments, so those who are acquainted with Deep Learning and Tensorflow, but don't know how to use Keras
on top of Tensorflow, they can easily grab the comments and learn from it.

The version of Tensorflow is '1.12.0' so the code has changed a bit in one place while Flatten() is used. You will get it eventually.
